Introduction

I'm using freeware version of Interactive Diassembler Pro 4.3. You can get it here, for example: http://www.programmersheaven.com/download/37637/download.aspx

After you have disassembler, you have to start disassembling orion95.exe from 1.31 patch. When it is doing something in background (disassembling), run orion95.idc file to import my IDA database.
